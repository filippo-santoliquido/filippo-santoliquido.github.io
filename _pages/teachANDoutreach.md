# Teaching and Mentoring

## Teaching

* Nov. 2021, **Physics Lab assistant**. I supported students that learnt basic programming skills for data analysis in C++ (20 h/yr)

* Jun. 2021, **Laboratory of Computational Astrophysics**. I tutored a group of three students that completed a project using [cosmo$\mathcal{R}$ate](/software/){: .btn--research} (12 h/yr)

* Nov. 2020, **Physics Lab assistant**. I supported students that learnt basic programming skills for data analysis in C++ (20 h/yr)

## Mentoring

* Mar. 2022, **Co-supervisor of Lorenzo Merli's master thesis**. Lorenzo looked at the evolution of the properties of Population III stars that can generate merging binary black holes at high redshift. 


* Dec. 2021, **Co-supervisor of Roberta Rufolo's master thesis**. Roberta explored the impact of various prescritpions modelling the spin distributions of binary black holes detectable with LIGO-Virgo inteferometers. My main task was to guide her through the various functionalities of our codes.


# Outreach 

* Sep. 29, 2023, **volunteer at [SHARPER23](https://www.sharper-night.it/sharper-laquila/)**

* Nov. 27, 2020, **Night of Researchers**. The 2020 Night of Researchers was followed by more than 500 people. I briefly introduced the gravitational wave topic and gave some short updates of my research work. At this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA_X20AdT0s) you can find the full recording. 

* Oct. 2018 - Mar. 2020, **Guide for the Museum of History of Physics**. I have been a guide for the [Museum of History of Physics](https://www.musei.unipd.it/en/physics) of the University of Padova. The visits were meant for both elementary and high school students
