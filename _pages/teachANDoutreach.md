# Teaching and Mentoring


* Mar. 2022, **Co-supervisor of Lorenzo Merli's master thesis**. With Lorenzo we looked at the evolution of the properties of population III stars that can generate mergign binary black holes at high redshift. 

* Dec. 2021, **Co-supervisor of Roberta Rufolo's master thesis**. With Roberta, we explored the impact of various prescritpions modelling the spin distributions of binary black holes detectable with LIGO-Virgo inteferometers. My main task was to guide her through the various functionalities of our codes.

* Nov. 2021, **Physics Lab assistant**. I supported students that learnt basic programming skills for data analysis in C++ (20 h/yr)

* Jun. 2021, **Laboratory of Computational Astrophysics**. I tutored a group of three students that completed a project using ```cosmoRate``` (12 h/yr)

* Nov. 2020, **Physics Lab assistant**. I supported students that learnt basic programming skills for data analysis in C++ (20 h/yr)

# Outreach 


* Nov. 27, 2020, **Night of Researchers**. The 2020 Night of Researchers was followed by more than 500 people. I briefly introduced the gravitational wave topic and gave some short updates of my research work.

* Oct. 2018 - Mar. 2020, **Guide for the Museum of History of Physics**. I have been a guide for the Museum of History of Physics (Via Loredan 10, Padova). From January 2019, I regularly held visits at the museum for elementary and high school students
