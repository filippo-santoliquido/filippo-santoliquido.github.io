# Teaching and Mentoring

## Teaching

* Aug. 6, 2024, **Hands-on section on cosmo$\mathcal{R}$ate**. Click [here](/chile/){: .btn--research} to access lecture material. Universidad Andrés Bello, Santiago, Chile. (2 hours)

* Aug. 2024, **Lecturer of the course "Gravitational Wave Astrophysics" during the school "Cosmological History: from Gravitational Waves to Exoplanets"**. Click [here](/Brazil/){: .btn--research} to access lecture material. [ICTP-SAIFR](https://www.ictp-saifr.org/)/[IFT-UNESP](https://www.ift.unesp.br/), São Paulo, Brazil. (4 hours + hands-on sections)

* Nov. 2021, **Physics Lab assistant**. I supported students during learning of basic programming skills for data analysis in C++. Univeristy of Padova, Italy. (20 h/yr)

* Jun. 2021, **Laboratory of Computational Astrophysics**. I tutored a group of three students that completed a project using [cosmo$\mathcal{R}$ate](/software/){: .btn--research}. Univeristy of Padova, Italy. (12 h/yr)

* Nov. 2020, **Physics Lab assistant**. I supported students learning basic programming skills for data analysis in C++. Univeristy of Padova, Italy. (20 h/yr)

## Mentoring

* Mar. 2022, **Co-supervisor of Lorenzo Merli's master thesis**. Lorenzo looked at the evolution of the properties of Population III stars that can generate merging binary black holes at high redshift. 


* Dec. 2021, **Co-supervisor of Roberta Rufolo's master thesis**. Roberta explored the impact of various prescritpions modelling the spin distributions of binary black holes detectable with LIGO-Virgo inteferometers. My main task was to guide her through the various functionalities of our codes.


# Outreach 

*  Outreach lectures on Physics and Astrophysics to high school classes:
	* Mar. 25, 2024, "Alessandro Volta" high school, Pescara, Italy
	* Jan. 25, 2024, "Albert Einstein" high school, Teramo, Italy

* An outreach article presenting the research I conducted during my PhD was published in the [Giornale di Astronomia, Vol. 50](https://giornaleastronomia.difa.unibo.it/). You can donwloand a [copy](/assets/images/premioTacchini23.pdf) of this article *(only in Italian)*.  

* Sep. 29, 2023, **volunteer at [SHARPER23](https://www.sharper-night.it/sharper-laquila/)** <img src="/assets/images/sharper_site.jpg"  width="400" height="150">

<em>Everything ready for the kilonova esperiment :) <em>


* Nov. 27, 2020, **Night of Researchers**. The 2020 Night of Researchers was followed by more than 500 people. I briefly introduced the gravitational wave topic and gave some short updates of my research work. At this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA_X20AdT0s) you can find the full recording. 

* Oct. 2018 - Mar. 2020, **Guide for the Museum of History of Physics**. I have been a guide for the [Museum of History of Physics](https://www.musei.unipd.it/en/physics) of the University of Padova. The visits were meant for both elementary and high school students
